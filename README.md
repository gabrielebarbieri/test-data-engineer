# Data Engineer Test - Proof of Concept
In this repository you'll find the code needed to develop a simple proof of concept of the predictive service you design for the Qucit's Data Engineer test.

The file [test_dataengineer.py](https://github.com/gabrielebarbieri/test-data-engineer/blob/master/test_dataengineer.py) contains some code to train two simple models:
- A bike model 
- A parking model
